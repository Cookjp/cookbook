FEATURE IDEAS
// implement something to do with skippable steps and ingredients like step 1 in carbonara
// add some sort of search based on ingredients (what's in my fridge sort of thing)
// CC: Flow feature? I.e. circles for prep. diamond for cooking. can things happen simulatenously? top line is tasks. drop down of items describing ongoing events
// button to list ingredients next to each step
// Select a group of recipes. make a shopping list.
